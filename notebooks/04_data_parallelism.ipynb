As a result, the updated model must be broadcast and replicated to the other devices at every training step, which is quite expensive.

    "- **Q1:** How can `all-reduce` be performed when not all gradients have been computed during `backward()`?\n",
    "  - **A1:** Since `backward()` proceeds sequentially from the later layers to the earlier ones, gradients can be communicated as soon as each layer’s gradients are computed.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Q2:** Then how often is `all-reduce` performed? Is it done for every layer?\n",
    "  - **A2:** No. **Gradient bucketing** is used. All-reduce is triggered when a bucket becomes full.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Gradient Bucketing\n",
    "Gradient bucketing is a technique in which gradients are accumulated into buckets of a fixed size and sent to other processes once a bucket is full. During the `backward()` pass, gradients computed from the later layers are sequentially stored in a bucket. When the bucket reaches its capacity, an All-reduce operation is performed to distribute the summed gradients to each device.\n",
    "\n",
    "The diagram may be a bit confusing, but note that what is stored in the bucket is **not model parameters**, but the **gradients produced by each layer**. All buckets have a fixed size, which can be configured in megabytes using the `bucket_size_mb` argument.\n",
