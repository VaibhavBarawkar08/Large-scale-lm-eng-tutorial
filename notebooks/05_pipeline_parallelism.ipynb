    "Pipeline parallelism is an improvement over inter-layer model parallelism. Inter-layer model parallelism is a method in which specific layers are assigned to specific GPUs, as shown below. In the figure, layers 1, 2, and 3 are assigned to GPU 1, while layers 4 and 5 are assigned to GPU 2. Each partitioned segment is called a **stage**. In this example, the model is split into two stages.\n",

In other words, as illustrated below, inter-layer model parallelism has a critical limitation: **only one GPU can be utilized at a time**.\n",

    "\n",
    "`PipeDream`, released by Microsoft, performs pipelining in a slightly different way compared to `GPipe`. This approach is commonly referred to as **1F1B**. Unlike GPipe, which performs the backward pass only after all forward passes are completed, PipeDream alternates between **forward** and **backward** passes.\n",

    "2. Work partitioning  \n",

    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1) Weight Version Management\n",
    "In the case of GPipe, only a single version of the weights is maintained, but periodic **pipeline flushes** occur. A pipeline flush refers to the process of updating parameters using the computed gradients. During this flush phase, no forward or backward computations are performed, which reduces processing efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/pipeline_flush.png\" width=600>\n",

However, this requires maintaining **multiple versions of the model parameters**. If only the latest version of the parameters were stored, a situation could arise where the next layer is updated while outputs from previous layers are still being propagated.\n",

    "<img src=\"../images/1f1b.gif\" width=800>\n",

    "### 2) Work Partitioning\n",
    "The second challenge concerns how to partition the neural network. Simply assigning the same number of layers to each partition is not always the best solution. The most important goal is to **minimize idle time**, which requires the execution time of each partition to be as balanced as possible. In addition, factors such as parameter size and activation memory must also be considered.\n",

Because flushes occur, the idle time is similar to that of GPipe, but the amount of **activation memory that must be maintained during the forward–backward process is reduced**. Since PipeDream Flush performs flushes, there is no need to manage multiple versions of parameters. As a result, only a single set of weights needs to be maintained, making it even more memory-efficient than PipeDream 2BW.

    "Previously, each stage (a contiguous set of layers) was computed sequentially to produce outputs. For example, if there are 8 layers and 2 devices, layers 1–4 are typically assigned to device 1, and layers 5–8 to device 2. In this setup, device 1 executes layers 1–4 sequentially and then outputs the result. (Both GPipe and 1F1B operate in this manner.)\n",
    "\n",
    "![](../images/interleaved_1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "However, **interleaved scheduling overlaps the execution within a single stage to drastically reduce bubble time**. For instance, if device 1 is assigned layers 1–4, it can execute layers 1–2 and layers 3–4 concurrently. This approach reduces bubble time, but it increases communication overhead, so careful tuning is required. (There is a trade-off.)\n"
