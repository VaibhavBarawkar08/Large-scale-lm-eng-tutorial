    "2. The PyTorch launcher acts as the main process and spawns the entire user program as subprocesses.\n",

    "We will examine both approaches. The term *“spawn”* here refers to a process acting as a parent and launching multiple subprocesses simultaneously.\n",

    "Message passing refers to a method in which multiple processes that do not share the same address space exchange data indirectly through messages. For example, if Process-1 is coded to send data with a specific tag to a message queue, and Process-2 is coded to receive that data, the two processes can exchange information without sharing any memory space. Most distributed communication techniques used in large-scale model development rely on this message passing approach.\n",
